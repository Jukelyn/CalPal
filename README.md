# Calendar Parser
I am tired of manually counting how many total hours I am scheduled for.

## Usage
The input dates assume 21st century. If for some reason somebody sees this project beyond 2099, feel free to edit that in the `get_start_day` and `get_end_day` functions.

Default dates (leaving blank when asked) are from the current day to a week from the current day. Current day, as in, literally today, the day you are using the program, not the day I am writing this.

More stuff TBA...
